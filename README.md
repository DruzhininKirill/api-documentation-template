API Documentation Template
====================

This a documentation template for GSA APIs provided by GSA Digital Services to provide a consistent look and feel for GSA APIs.  

Thanks to CFPB team for creating this model and for furthering open source in government.  Additional inspiration from the 18F and the SAM (IAE) teams, as well as [Kin Lane](https://apievangelist.com/).

## Using This Template In GitHub Pages
Currently this template is configured to work on GitHub pages. The easiest way to use this template is by [cloning this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) and using it as a starting point for your own project. 

We are recommending that your API documentation reside in a dedicated repository. However, this code all resides under the "docs" folder, so it is possible to include it with your API code. Either way, you will need to update the Settings/Github Pages to point to "master/docs". 

It is also helpful to put a link on the "Code" tab of your GitHub repo to the working docs page (see above for example). Notice that you should add "/api-docs/" to the location that GitHub generates, to find the home page of your doco.

## Note About Swagger
This example contains a demonstration of the Swagger UI to provide interactive sample calls to the API. This is based on the [Open API Specification](http://swagger.io/specification/) for modeling the API. Other options for API modeling s include [RAML](http://raml.org/), [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/), and several more.   

## Helping us improve
Please feel free to add issues and pull requests for any recommendations you think would be worthwhile for all users of the template.
