API Documentation Template
====================

This is the documentation template for GSA APIs.

This provides a consistent look and feel across our APIs throughout the organization.  API developers will be able to follow through a standard process for creating and publishing APIs.  API consumers will appeciate consistent documentation style.

Thanks to CFPB team for creating this model and for furthering open source in government.  Additional inspiration from the 18F and the SAM (IAE) teams, as well as [Kin Lane](https://apievangelist.com/).

## Using This Template In GitHub Pages
Currently this template is configured to work on GitHub pages. The easiest way to use this template is by [forking this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and using it as a starting point for your own project. You can keep the doco in its own repo, or include your project's code in the same repo.

#### Step 1: Click the Fork button in this repo

#### Step 2: Select where to put the fork (probably under your user or organization)

#### Step 3: In your repository's Settings/GitHub Pages, select a source of "master branch /docs folder"
After you do this, GitHub will display "Your site is ready to be published at". Copy this URL.

#### Step 4: Paste this URL in your browser bar, and add "/api-docs/" onto the end of it.
Hit enter, and you should see a working copy of the documentation in your browser.

#### Step 5: Update the web page on your repo's Code tab
On your repository's "Code" tab, Click the edit button next to the label "View example documentation here". Change the description to fit your purposes and paste the URL from step 4 in the "Website" box.
