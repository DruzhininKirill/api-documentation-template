API Documentation Template
====================

This a documentation template for GSA APIs provided by GSA Digital Services to provide a consistent look and feel for GSA APIs.  

Thanks to CFPB team for creating this model and for furthering open source in government.  Additional inspiration from the 18F and the SAM (IAE) teams, as well as [Kin Lane](https://apievangelist.com/).

## Using This Template In GitHub Pages
Currently this template is configured to work on GitHub pages. The easiest way to use this template is by [cloning this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/) and using it as a starting point for your own project. 

Your API's code should be in a separate repo from your API documentation.

## Helping us improve
Please feel free to add issues and pull requests for any recommendations you think would be worthwhile for all users of the template.
