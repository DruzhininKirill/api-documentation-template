API Documentation Template
====================

This is the documentation template for GSA APIs.

This provides a consistent look and feel across our APIs throughout the organization.  API developers will be able to follow through a standard process for creating and publishing APIs.  API consumers will appeciate consistent documentation style.

Thanks to CFPB team for creating this model and for furthering open source in government.  Additional inspiration from the 18F and the SAM (IAE) teams, as well as [Kin Lane](https://apievangelist.com/).
