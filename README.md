API Documentation Template
====================

This is the documentation template for GSA APIs.

This provides a consistent look and feel across our APIs throughout the organization.  API developers will be able to follow through a standard process for creating and publishing APIs.  API consumers will appeciate consistent documentation style.

Thanks to CFPB team for creating this model and for furthering open source in government.  Additional inspiration from the 18F and the SAM (IAE) teams, as well as [Kin Lane](https://apievangelist.com/).

## Using This Template In GitHub Pages
Currently this template is configured to work on GitHub pages. To use it in this manner, one of these options will work:

### 1. Copy the "Docs" folder to your project's GitHub repository
This is probably the quickest method. You can clone this repository to a local repository, then copy the entire Docs folder into your repository's master branch. 

### 2. Duplicate this repository
Basically creating a copy of this and not forking the original. There are a couple of methods to do this. Here are the instructions from GitHub: https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/

### For Option #1 and #2:

If you want these docs to be the documentation for your entire repository, configure this in your repository settings in GitHub. To be even nicer to users, you can also edit the link on the home page of your repository.
